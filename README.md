## Testing

1. Clone the respoitory with a git client, or download the source code ZIP from GitHub and extract it.
2. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm (Node's package manager) installed.
3. In the project's root folder, run ``npm install`` to download the required dependencies.
4. Run ``npm start`` to test/run the project.

## Building

Run ``npx electron-builder`` to build.

The package.json should already specify the building behavior for Windows and Linux, but macOS has not been tested.
